# Predicting-the-2023-NBA-Draft-Class
A machine learning analysis of the 2023 NBA prospects. This project used Player Efficiency Rating (PER) to evaluate prospect career success.  
  
The project goes through:  
-Data Collection: Collection is done in multiple batches   
-Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning is necessary for NBA Player data  
-NBA PER Tier Definition: Summary Statistics were useful  
-Data Analysis: Correlations, summary statistics, and multicollinearity  
-Model Training and Performance: 10 different models  
-Model Fitting (Career PER Prediction): Top 3 models fit with prospect data  
  
Through this project, flaws with the models are highlighted, and the true value of utilizeing data to derive valuable insights for scouting is reinforced.
